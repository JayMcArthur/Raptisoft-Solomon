Well, most of the potions you can buy around here aren't worth spit.  But I have a natural talent, and my own concoctions are far superior.
Endowed with such skill, why am I selling out of this little stand?
Well, fearing my talent, the Brewer's Guild has denied me my trade license.  But a man of my caliber is hardly going to be stopped by petty restrictions.
Since the Guild refuses to provide the ingredients I need, I search them out myself.  I keep charts of all the exciting new lands I discover along the way, available to you at low cost!
...The Cartographer's Guild doesn't like this much, but guys who can poison don't have to pay dues, I explained.

<A>
Ah yes, Solomon Dark.  I believe he was in one of my classes.
I tend not to think too highly of people who aren't me, but I hear he turned out to be rather gifted in the end.  Hope that works out for him.

<Q>Any tips?</Q>
<A>
It is wise that you ask for my counsel, as I am naturally far better equipped to enlighten than any of these others.
The most useful advice I can offer you is that it is vitally important to find your own path through life, free from other people's biases, and thus you should ignore all advice.

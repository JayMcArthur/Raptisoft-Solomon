<INTRO>
Pleased to meet you, mate.  I'm the College's resident scavenger.
Basically, that means it's my humble jobbing duty to trudge out into the field and retrieve the remains-- and by remains, I mean little bits and pieces-- of wizards and witches who've gone and done themselves a magical mishap, so they can get buried proper.
Now, between you and me, there's no point burying the dead with all their stuff, eh? They don't need it.  Other people might.  Share and share alike-- right?

<Q>Isn't this bad luck?</Q>
<A>
Rubbish! If there was any bad luck in wearing clothes off a dead man, I'd be dead myself by now!
</A>

<Q>Magical mishaps?</Q>
<A>
You know... accidental detonations, unexpected demons, enchanted wardrobe malfunctions-- the usual sort of fatalities.
Tell you what though, business has been booming lately.  I reckon it's got something to do with that rogue wizard bloke.

<Q>College scavenger?</Q>
<A>
Weeeelllll, the technical term for the job's something more along the lines of resident Mortician-In-Wait, but that makes it sound like the kind of gig where I'd have to wear a tie.

<A>
Solomon Dark? 
Now there's a fellow who I'd like to shake by the hand.  Thanks to him, my business is up three hundred percent...
...and that's just in the last two months!  He's going through faculty members like a Basilisk Hound goes through babies.

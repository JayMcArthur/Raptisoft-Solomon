Welcome to the palace of _idead_i careers.
Cast your eyes on these legions of lost souls.  Learn their stories that you might avoid their fate!
Also to show respect, that too.

<Q>How did these mages die?</Q>
<A>
Well, the Archchancellor isn't telling, but it's pretty obvious.
There's been some secret hush hush wink mission regarding an ex-graduate, and wizards started coming back dead when they came back at all.  
I think when the count passed five someone decided we needed an official memorial to commemorate the victims.  Otherwise someone in charge might have to answer some nasty questions.

<Q>Tell me about these guys</Q>
<A>
Lead me to a painting and I'll give you the official eulogy along with some suitably funereal banter.

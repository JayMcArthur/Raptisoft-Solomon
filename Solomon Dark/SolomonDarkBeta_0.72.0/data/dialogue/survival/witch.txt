I have a wide variety of charms, blessings, curses and talismans.  Good for the digestion, good for the soul.

Well, see here: Mixing up these things is a lot of work.
But it's a lot _iless_i work once I've opened the right bags and cleaned the right tools and measured out the right ingredients.
So, fair do's, my embellishments are a lot less expensive if I've mixed them up recently.

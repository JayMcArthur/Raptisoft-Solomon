<INTRO>
Look at all those blue robes running around.  How many of them do you think will graduate?  One in ten.  How many of them will do anything interesting?  Not one in a hundred... but I still have to write every single thing they do down!
I'm the College Annalist.  That means it's my job to keep records.  Even when the people I'm recording are so dull they make me want to slip into a boredom coma.
...Say, you're the one they're throwing at Solomon Dark, aren't you?  Now that guy, he may be evil, but at least he livens up the history!    He's done for ten of the junior faculty so far.  Good on you for making an epic struggle out of it!
So then, give me your name and specialty, and I'll get your chronicle started.  I hope you have some good pithy one-liners.

<Q>The Annals?</Q>
<A>
The university annals chronicle all things large and small, to a tedious degree, that happen to the wizards of this university.
Those of us with literary flair are naturally drafted to do take up the quill and perform this important task.
Be polite to me, or your personal history will go into an embarrasing depth of detail.

<Q>Solomon Dark?</Q>
<A>
Let me consult the Annals.
Let's see-- it wasn't me who chronicled this-- here we go, Solomon Dark, cross-referenced under "friendless," "evil," and "jerk."
"It says he was an unremarkable student, maintaining his mediocrity until nobody was looking.  And he liked to pick the wings off flies, hm.
Personally, I remember the fuss when-- well, he called it his "Graduation Party."  Ah, now _ithose_i were the days to be an Annalist.

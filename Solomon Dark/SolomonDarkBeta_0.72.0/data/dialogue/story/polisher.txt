Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, step away from the manticore.  It's still a little bit poisonous.
</INTRO>

<Q>What are you doing?</Q>
<A>
That slob Glanthicus was in here eating like an animal and managed to get some magic honey on the plaque.
The stuff resists all housekeeping spells, so it has to be removed by hand.  You can't even disintegrate it.
Worse, it's level 9 honey.  I'll probably be here all day.

<Q>The Manticore?</Q>
<A>
It's just a baby, but pretty toxic.
It says everything about it on the plaque, if you read Obtuse.  I don't.
All I can tell you is, it was a manticore, then someone killed it, then someone stuffed it and stuck it here.

I know, right?
</A>

<Q>The Plaque</Q>
<A>
It's written in Obtuse, the language Conchiphus Obfuscate invented to make the written word more tedious and intimidating.
You can write "_iRoses smell nice_i" in Obtuse and it'll be six scrolls long and scare peasants.
Anyway, I don't read it, I just clean it.  The librarian probably has it written down in Normal somewhere.

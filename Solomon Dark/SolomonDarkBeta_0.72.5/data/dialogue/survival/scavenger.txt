<INTRO>
Pleased to meet you, mate.  I'm the College's resident scavenger.
Basically, that means it's my humble jobbing duty to trudge out into the field and retrieve the remains-- and by remains, I mean little bits and pieces-- of wizards and witches who've gone and done themselves a magical mishap.  So they can get buried proper.
Now, between you and me, there's no point burying the dead with all their stuff, eh? They don't need it.  Other people might.  Share and share alike-- right?

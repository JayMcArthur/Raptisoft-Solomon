<INTRO>
What are you looking at?  What do you want?  Whatever it is, buy it quickly and leave me alone.
Are you one of the University faculty? Can't stand the faculty. Oooh-- you're not the poor, gullible idiot they're sending to attack Solomon Dark, are you? Gods, that's hilarious. I should be nice to you, it'll help me recover my karma.
Let's see... I have a wide variety of charms, blessings, curses and talismans.  If you're very lucky, some of them might even keep you alive for a few extra minutes.

<Q>Cost of Charms?</Q>
<A>
Well, see here: Mixing up these things is a lot of work.
But it's a lot _iless_i work once I've opened the right bags and cleaned the right tools and measured out the right ingredients.
So, fair do's, my embellishments are a lot less expensive if I've mixed them up recently.
</A>

<Q>Your attitude?</Q>
<A>
You'd be tetchy too if you had to cope with a bunch of dreary old professors who only stop leering for long enough to patronise you.
For the record, I'm here out of _igood will_i.
The Archchancellor _iinvited_i me, because I'm good with charms and the rest of you are lacking in that department.
</A>

<Q>Solomon Dark?</Q>
<A>
He's the reason I'm here, so I can't say I think anything nice about him.
Other than that, I've only been let in on the basics.  I know he's some mad wizard.  I know he's a tough one.
Clearly he's making a lot of trouble for the faculty here, so he can't be all bad.
</A>
		
<Q>Where are you from?</Q>
<A>
The swamps near Heck Hollow, where the townsfolk _iappreciate_i me.
At least, the ones I haven't cursed do.  And the ones I haven't locked in a tall tower.  Or got with that gingerbread house.
</A>

<Q>Any tips?</Q>
<A>
If you see an opportunity to die quickly and painlessly, I suggest you take it.

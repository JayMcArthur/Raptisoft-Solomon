<NAME>Declarius</NAME>

<INTRO>
Welcome to the palace of _idead_i careers.
But I shouldn't be here.
I am Declarias--son of High Sorcerer Decantus, who famously slew the Last Unicorn... Grandson of War Wizard Delantus, who singlehandedly defeated the Frost Orphans of the North.
Battle magic is in my veins!  I should be out inventing deadly new spells, not indoors babysitting urns.
So.  Here's the Wizard's Memorial.  Have a look around.

<Q>About Memorial</Q>

Well, the Archchancellor isn't telling, but it's pretty obvious.
There's been some secret hush hush wink mission regarding an ex-graduate, and wizards started coming back dead when they came back at all.  
I think when the count passed five someone decided we needed an official memorial to commemorate the victims.  Otherwise someone in charge might have to answer some nasty questions.

Lead me to a painting and I'll give you the official eulogy along with some suitably funereal banter.

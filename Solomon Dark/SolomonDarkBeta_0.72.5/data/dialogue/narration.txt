SAY_EULOGY_INTERRUPT1=Oh, okay, you're not interested in that?  Well thank you very much.
SAY_EULOGY_INTERRUPT2=Oh, yes, just walk away.  I'd hate to bore you.
SAY_EULOGY_INTERRUPT3=Oh, never mind this guy's story, right?  I'm sure he'd want it that way.
SAY_EULOGY_INTERRUPT4=Ummm-hmmm
SAY_EULOGY_0=This portrait is of Sirmin the Wizard.

SAY_EULOGY_9=This portrait is of Andra the Medium.
SAY_BADEULOGY_0=Pathetic example of wizardry, really.
SAY_BADEULOGY_1=What a senseless waste of human life.
SAY_BADEULOGY_2=This would be tragic if it wasn't so utterly predictable.
SAY_BADEULOGY_3=Tsk.  More bravado than magic.
SAY_BADEULOGY_4=Whoever sent this guy out should be ashamed.
SAY_BADEULOGY_5=Powerful magic.. But slow.. So slow.

SAY_INEEDAKEY=I need a key!
SAY_DANGER1=Danger!
SAY_DANGER2=Danger!
SAY_BOAST_SURVIVALEULOGY0=Lucritius tells me it looks like this guy didn't drink a single potion during his whole ordeal!  You know, He told me he was going to do that!  I advised him against it, but he was completely mad, insisted he could pull it off.  They're calling his death a suicide.
SAY_BOAST_SURVIVALEULOGY1=So word on the street is this guy was found without a single magical implement on him.  Talk about overconfident!  You know, I seem to recall him saying something about not using magical implements when I was getting his name for the Annals... I advised againt it, in fact.  You can't help some people.  They're calling his death a suicide.
SAY_BOAST_SURVIVALEULOGY2=Did you know, when they did the skry-autopsy on this one, they found out he didn't even cast some of the most useful spells in the grimoire?  They're calling his death a suicide.  Hm... I seem to recall him strutting around saying he wouldn't cast secondary magic.  I advised against that, of course.
SAY_BOAST_SURVIVALEULOGY3=So get this... as this guy is leaving, he tells me he's going to invoke the Rite of Thaumaturgic Channelling and take whatever spell wants him.  I advised against that, but he wasn't listening to anyone at that point.  They're calling it suicide.  Oh well, it makes an interesting footnote, at least, how often does this happen?
SAY_BOAST_SURVIVALEULOGY4=I remember this guy.  As he's leaving, he tells me he never runs out of mana.  Have you ever heard anything like that?  There's overconfidence, and then there's our wizard here.  They tell me he actually _idid_i it, too-- there's not a single sign that he ever overtaxed his node.  Such a pity about the ink shortage, this really deserved to be written down.
